# Noise

Python implementation of the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/)

Noise is a low-level framework for building crypto protocols. Noise protocols support mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features.

Majorly influenced by [Flynn's Go implementation of Noise Protocol](https://github.com/flynn/noise) and [Piotr Lizo≈Ñczyk's python library](https://github.com/plizonczyk/noiseprotocol)
